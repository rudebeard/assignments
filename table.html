        To Build a Fire is the story of a young miner who has come to the Yukon to find gold. He is
        traveling toward his camp on a cold, windy afternoon, against the advice of a seasoned
        miner. He falls through some ice and gets his feet wet, necessitating building a fire to dry off
        and warm up.</td>

        looking at his watch. It was nine o clock in the morning. There was no sun or promise of sun, although there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a
        clear day. However, here seemed to be an indescribable darkness over the face of things. That was because the sun was absent from the
        SKV.
        This fact did not worry the man. He was not alarmed ov the lack of sun. It had been davs since he had seen the sun.
